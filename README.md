This directory contains the GEANT4 simulations, the de-convolution(Solve S in C=RS matrix equation) algorithms for neutron spectrum. 
The "GEANT4_NCD" contains the simulations used to determine resposne for results shown in the presentation, and its contains "NCD_General" simulation which can be edited to run simulation for layered HDPE and BHDPE moderators of varying thickness.
The NCD_PYTHON contains the analysis scripts used for unfolding.
